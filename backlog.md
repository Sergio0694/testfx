# Testing Backlog (testfx) — cursor & opportunities

## Completed
- 2026-09-18: Added unit tests for `TestDataSourceUtilities.ComputeDefaultDisplayName`
  (src/TestFramework/TestFramework/Internal/TestDataSourceUtilities.cs) — previously had ZERO direct
  unit test coverage despite being a shipped internal API used by DataRowAttribute, DynamicDataAttribute,
  CombinatorialDataAttribute, TestMethodRunner.DataSource, and AssemblyEnumerator. Covers: null data,
  primitive formatting, string/char quoting, null argument literal, single-object-array-parameter
  special case, recursive nested array humanization, non-object array humanization, empty data array,
  ReflectionTestMethodInfo.DisplayName usage, and repeated-call StringBuilder-cache safety.
  PR #8 (branch test-assist/test-data-source-utilities-display-name). Still open as of 2026-09-19.
- 2026-09-19: Added 2 unit tests to `TestMethodRunnerTests.cs` covering the folded (`ITestDataSource`)
  data-driven path's display-name precedence in `TestMethodRunner.DataSource.cs`
  (`testDataSource.GetDisplayName(...) ?? ComputeDefaultDisplayName(...) ?? displayName`) — this
  precedence chain had no direct test, only incidental coverage via `DataRowAttribute`'s own
  `GetDisplayName`. Added a minimal private `CustomDisplayNameDataSourceAttribute : ITestDataSource`
  test double. PR branch: test-assist/test-method-runner-display-name-precedence.

## Backlog / opportunities not yet actioned
- `src/TestFramework/TestFramework/Internal/StringEx.cs` — reviewed 2026-09-19: these are trivial
  one-line pass-throughs around `string.IsNullOrEmpty`/`string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace`. NOT pursuing —
  no meaningful logic to test (see "What NOT to Test" guideline). Remove from backlog.
- Review `src/Analyzers/MSTest.Analyzers` C# rule test coverage gaps (VB.NET tests are explicitly OUT OF
  SCOPE per repo-specific constraint — do not propose VB tests for analyzers).
- No coverage tooling was run this session (time-boxed); consider running the existing coverage pipeline
  (check azure-pipelines.yml / stryker-config.json for mutation testing config) in a future run to find
  quantified gaps rather than relying on git-history heuristics.
- The unfolded (non-`ITestDataSource`) path in `TestMethodRunner.DataSource.cs` uses the same
  `ExecuteTestWithDataSourceAsync` method but is invoked with `testDataSource: null` from
  `TestMethodRunner.cs` — that branch always takes the `displayNameFromTestDataRow ?? displayName`
  path (no `ComputeDefaultDisplayName` involved), already implicitly covered by existing `DataRow`-based
  tests. No further action needed there.

## Cursor
- Last task 2 (opportunity discovery) scan: searched for files changed in 60 days (repo only has 1 commit
  of history available in this shallow clone — history-based "bug-prone area" heuristic is NOT usable here;
  rely on architecture/complexity reading instead).
- Next run: consider Task 6 (test infrastructure) or Task 4 (check on PR #8 and the new display-name-
  precedence PR for CI status / maintainer feedback).
